        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven.</p>
                <p>Heat oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While oil heats, set out 3 wide shallow bowls.</p>
                <p>Fill them individually with flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Working with a handful of bites at a time, gently dredge cheese in flour, and shake off excess. </p>
                <p>Dip in eggs; let excess drip off. Dredge in breadcrumbs to coat.</p>
                <p>Place on a small rimmed baking sheet or large plate. Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fry boursin bites in batches, cooking until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Set on paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bites. Transfer to a platter and serve immediately. </p>
